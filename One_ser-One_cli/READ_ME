Overview:

This project demonstrates a simple one client and one server communication using sockets in C++. The server listens for incoming connections, while the client connects to the server to exchange messages.

Features

    Basic socket communication using TCP.
    Server can handle one client connection at a time.
    Exits gracefully upon receiving a "bye" message.


Requirements

    C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
    Linux operating system

Compilation
   g++ -o server server.cpp
   g++ -o client client.cpp


Note:
   First execute server binary and then execute client binary with argument port mention in code or you can change port before compilation and in 
   client execution give port as argument.
